## This is my first blog post

and I am really excited about it

And this looks very `computer science`-like

Maybe some code for you?

```python
print("hElLo WoRlD! :-)")
```

ok let me see

 ```tsql
 SELECT *
 FROM sys.tables
 WHERE [name] = 'SomeTable'
 ```
 
 and let me also test some latex stuff like
 
 $$ \nabla_\boldsymbol{x} J(\boldsymbol{x}) \\
 L(\boldsymbol{w}, b, \boldsymbol{\alpha}, \boldsymbol{\mu}, \boldsymbol{zeta})=\frac{1}{2} ||\boldsymbol{w} ||^2 + C \sum_{i=1}^{N} \boldsymbol{zeta}_i - \sum_{i=1}^N \boldsymbol{\alpha}_i (y_i (\boldsymbol{w}^\top \boldsymbol{phi}(\boldsymbol{x})+b) - 1 + \boldsymbol{zeta}_i) - \sum_{i = 1}^N \boldsymbol{\mu}_i \boldsymbol{zeta}_i$$
